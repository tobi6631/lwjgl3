		Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

		This extension adds a new per-fragment test that is, logically, after the scissor test and before the alpha test. The depth bounds test compares the
		depth value stored at the location given by the incoming fragment's (xw,yw) coordinates to a user-defined minimum and maximum depth value. If the stored
		depth value is outside the user-defined range (exclusive), the incoming fragment is discarded.

		Unlike the depth test, the depth bounds test has NO dependency on the fragment's window-space depth value.

		This functionality is useful in the context of attenuated stenciled shadow volume rendering. To motivate the functionality's utility in this context, we
		first describe how conventional scissor testing can be used to optimize shadow volume rendering.

		If an attenuated light source's illumination can be bounded to a rectangle in XY window-space, the conventional scissor test can be used to discard
		shadow volume fragments that are guaranteed to be outside the light source's window-space XY rectangle. The stencil increments and decrements that would
		otherwise be generated by these scissored fragments are inconsequential because the light source's illumination can pre-determined to be fully
		attenuated outside the scissored region. In other words, the scissor test can be used to discard shadow volume fragments rendered outside the scissor,
		thereby improving performance, without affecting the ultimate illumination of these pixels with respect to the attenuated light source.

		This scissoring optimization can be used both when rendering the stenciled shadow volumes to update stencil (incrementing and decrementing the stencil
		buffer) AND when adding the illumination contribution of attenuated light source's.

		In a similar fashion, we can compute the attenuated light source's window-space Z bounds (zmin,zmax) of consequential illumination. Unless a depth value
		(in the depth buffer) at a pixel is within the range [zmin,zmax], the light source's illumination can be pre-determined to be inconsequential for the
		pixel. Said another way, the pixel being illuminated is either far enough in front of or behind the attenuated light source so that the light source's
		illumination for the pixel is fully attenuated. The depth bounds test can perform this test.

		Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

		This extension extends the EXT_framebuffer_object framework to enable multisample rendering.

		The new operation RenderbufferStorageMultisampleEXT() allocates storage for a renderbuffer object that can be used as a multisample buffer. A
		multisample render buffer image differs from a single-sample render buffer image in that a multisample image has a number of SAMPLES that is greater
		than zero. No method is provided for creating multisample texture images.

		All of the framebuffer-attachable images attached to a framebuffer object must have the same number of SAMPLES or else the framebuffer object is not
		"framebuffer complete". If a framebuffer object with multisample attachments is "framebuffer complete", then the framebuffer object behaves as if
		SAMPLE_BUFFERS is one.

		In traditional multisample rendering, where DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING_EXT is zero and SAMPLE_BUFFERS is one, the GL spec states that "the color sample
		values are resolved to a single, displayable color each time a pixel is updated." There are, however, several modern hardware implementations that do
		not actually resolve for each sample update, but instead postpones the resolve operation to a later time and resolve a batch of sample updates at a
		time. This is OK as long as the implementation behaves "as if" it had resolved a sample-at-a-time. Unfortunately, however, honoring the "as if" rule can
		sometimes degrade performance.

		In contrast, when DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING_EXT is an application-created framebuffer object, MULTISAMPLE is enabled, and SAMPLE_BUFFERS is one, there is
		no implicit per-sample-update resolve. Instead, the application explicitly controls when the resolve operation is performed. The resolve operation is
		affected by calling BlitFramebufferEXT (provided by the EXT_framebuffer_blit extension) where the source is a multisample application-created
		framebuffer object and the destination is a single-sample framebuffer object (either application-created or window-system provided).

		This design for multisample resolve more closely matches current hardware, but still permits implementations which choose to resolve a single sample at
		a time. If hardware that implementes the multisample resolution "one sample at a time" exposes EXT_framebuffer_multisample, it could perform the
		implicit resolve to a driver-managed hidden surface, then read from that surface when the application calls BlitFramebufferEXT.

		Another motivation for granting the application explicit control over the multisample resolve operation has to do with the flexibility afforded by
		EXT_framebuffer_object. Previously, a drawable (window or pbuffer) had exclusive access to all of its buffers. There was no mechanism for sharing a
		buffer across multiple drawables. Under EXT_framebuffer_object, however, a mechanism exists for sharing a framebuffer-attachable image across several
		framebuffer objects, as well as sharing an image between a framebuffer object and a texture. If we had retained the "implicit"
		resolve from traditional multisampled rendering, and allowed the creation of "multisample" format renderbuffers, then this type of sharing would have
		lead to two problematic situations:
		${ul(
			"Two contexts, which shared renderbuffers, might perform competing resolve operations into the same single-sample buffer with ambiguous results.",
		    "It would have introduced the unfortunate ability to use the single-sample buffer as a texture while MULTISAMPLE is ENABLED."
		)}
		By using the BlitFramebufferEXT from EXT_framebuffer_blit as an explicit resolve to serialize access to the multisampled contents and eliminate the
		implicit per-sample resolve operation, we avoid both of these problems.

		In traditional multisampled framebuffer rendering, color samples must be explicitly resolved via BlitFramebuffer before any other operation on the
		resulting pixel values can be performed. This multisample resolve operation must be done using a BlitFramebuffer call where the dimensions of the source

		performance. However, the scaling blit can still introduce artifacts, particularly if it is done with a simple bilinear filter.

		Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

		Conventionally, OpenGL assumes framebuffer color components are stored in a linear color space. In particular, framebuffer blending is a linear

		The sRGB color space is based on typical (non-linear) monitor characteristics expected in a dimly lit office. It has been standardized by the
		International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) as IEC 61966-2-1. The sRGB color space roughly corresponds to 2.2 gamma correction.

		This extension adds a framebuffer capability for sRGB framebuffer update and blending. When blending is disabled but the new sRGB updated mode is

		coloring are encoded for sRGB prior to being written into the framebuffer. When blending is enabled along with the new sRGB update mode, red, green, and

		generated by fragment coloring, and then the blend result is encoded for sRGB just prior to being written into the framebuffer.

		"""
		Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

		Many OpenGL implementations have chosen to interleave the depth and stencil buffers into one buffer, often with 24 bits of depth precision and 8 bits
		of stencil data. 32 bits is more than is needed for the depth buffer much of the time; a 24-bit depth buffer, on the other hand, requires that reads
		and writes of depth data be unaligned with respect to power-of-two boundaries. On the other hand, 8 bits of stencil data is more than sufficient for
		most applications, so it is only natural to pack the two buffers into a single buffer with both depth and stencil data. OpenGL never provides direct
		access to the buffers, so the OpenGL implementation can provide an interface to applications where it appears the one merged buffer is composed of two
		logical buffers.

		One disadvantage of this scheme is that OpenGL lacks any means by which this packed data can be handled efficiently. For example, when an application
		reads from the 24-bit depth buffer, using the type GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT will lose 8 bits of data, while GL_UNSIGNED_INT has 8 too many. Both require
		expensive format conversion operations. A 24-bit format would be no more suitable, because it would also suffer from the unaligned memory accesses that
		made the standalone 24-bit depth buffer an unattractive proposition in the first place.

		Many applications, such as parallel rendering applications, may also wish to draw to or read back from both the depth and stencil buffers at the same
		time. Currently this requires two separate operations, reducing performance. Since the buffers are interleaved, drawing to or reading from both should
		be no more expensive than using just one; in some cases, it may even be cheaper.

		This extension provides a new data format, GL_DEPTH_STENCIL_EXT, that can be used with the glDrawPixels, glReadPixels, and glCopyPixels commands, as
		well as a packed data type, GL_UNSIGNED_INT_24_8_EXT, that is meant to be used with GL_DEPTH_STENCIL_EXT. No other data types are supported with
		GL_DEPTH_STENCIL_EXT. If ARB_depth_texture or SGIX_depth_texture is supported, GL_DEPTH_STENCIL_EXT/GL_UNSIGNED_INT_24_8_EXT data can also be used for
		textures; this provides a more efficient way to supply data for a 24-bit depth texture.

		GL_DEPTH_STENCIL_EXT data, when passed through the pixel path, undergoes both depth and stencil operations. The depth data is scaled and biased by the
		current GL_DEPTH_SCALE and GL_DEPTH_BIAS, while the stencil data is shifted and offset by the current GL_INDEX_SHIFT and GL_INDEX_OFFSET. The stencil
		data is also put through the stencil-to-stencil pixel map.

		glDrawPixels of GL_DEPTH_STENCIL_EXT data operates similarly to that of GL_STENCIL_INDEX data, bypassing the OpenGL fragment pipeline entirely, unlike
		the treatment of GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT data. The stencil and depth masks are applied, as are the pixel ownership and scissor tests, but all other
		operations are skipped.

		glReadPixels of GL_DEPTH_STENCIL_EXT data reads back a rectangle from both the depth and stencil buffers.

		glCopyPixels of GL_DEPTH_STENCIL_EXT data copies a rectangle from both the depth and stencil buffers. Like glDrawPixels, it applies both the stencil
		and depth masks but skips the remainder of the OpenGL fragment pipeline.

		glTex[Sub]Image[1,2,3]D of GL_DEPTH_STENCIL_EXT data loads depth and stencil data into a depth_stencil texture. glGetTexImage of GL_DEPTH_STENCIL_EXT
		data can be used to retrieve depth and stencil data from a depth/stencil texture.

		In addition, a new base internal format, GL_DEPTH_STENCIL_EXT, can be used by both texture images and renderbuffer storage. When an image with a
		DEPTH_STENCIL_EXT internal format is attached to both the depth and stencil attachment points of a framebuffer object (see EXT_framebuffer_object),
		then it becomes both the depth and stencil buffers of the framebuffer. This fits nicely with hardware that interleaves both depth and stencil data into
		a single buffer. When a texture with DEPTH_STENCIL_EXT data is bound for texturing, only the depth component is accessible through the texture fetcher.
		The stencil data can be written with TexImage or CopyTexImage, and can be read with GetTexImage. When a DEPTH_STENCIL_EXT image is attached to the
		stencil attachment of the bound framebuffer object, the stencil data can be accessed through any operation that reads from or writes to the
		framebuffer's stencil buffer.

		per component in the same manner as 16-bit floating-point formats, but rather than 10 mantissa bits, the red, green, and blue components have 6, 6, and
		5 bits respectively. Each mantissa is assumed to have an implied leading one except in the denorm exponent case. There is no sign bit so only
		non-negative values can be represented. Positive infinity, positive denorms, and positive NaN values are representable. The value of the fourth
		component returned by a texture fetch is always 1.0.

		This extension also provides support for rendering into an unsigned floating-point rendering format with the assumption that the texture format
		described above could also be advertised as an unsigned floating-point format for rendering.

		The extension also provides a pixel external format for specifying packed float values directly.

		Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

		This extension supports additional geometric characteristics of points. It can be used to render particles or tiny light sources, commonly referred as
		"Light points".

		The raster brightness of a point is a function of the point area, point color, point transparency, and the response of the display's electron gun and
		phosphor. The point area and the point transparency are derived from the point size, currently provided with the {@code size} parameter of
		GL11#PointSize().

		The primary motivation is to allow the size of a point to be affected by distance attenuation. When distance attenuation has an effect, the final point
		size decreases as the distance of the point from the eye increases.

		The secondary motivation is a mean to control the mapping from the point size to the raster point area and point transparency. This is done in order to
		increase the dynamic range of the raster brightness of points. In other words, the alpha component of a point may be decreased (and its transparency
		increased) as its area shrinks below a defined threshold.

		This extension defines a derived point size to be closely related to point brightness. The brightness of a point is given by:
		${codeBlock("""
						1
dist_atten(d) = -------------------
                a + b * d + c * d^2

brightness(Pe) = Brightness * dist_atten(|Pe|)""")}
		where 'Pe' is the point in eye coordinates, and 'Brightness' is some initial value proportional to the square of the size provided with glPointSize.
		Here we simplify the raster brightness to be a function of the rasterized point area and point transparency.
		${codeBlock("""
			brightness(Pe)      brightness(Pe) >= Threshold_Area
area(Pe) =
			Threshold_Area      Otherwise

factor(Pe) = brightness(Pe)/Threshold_Area

alpha(Pe) = Alpha * factor(Pe)""")}
		where 'Alpha' comes with the point color (possibly modified by lighting).

		'Threshold_Area' above is in area units. Thus, it is proportional to the square of the threshold provided by the programmer through this extension.

		The new point size derivation method applies to all points, while the threshold applies to multisample points only.

		Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

		Texture mapping using OpenGL's existing mipmap texture filtering modes assumes that the projection of the pixel filter footprint into texture space is a
		square (ie, isotropic). In practice however, the footprint may be long and narrow (ie, anisotropic). Consequently, mipmap filtering severely blurs
		images on surfaces angled obliquely away from the viewer.

		Several approaches exist for improving texture sampling by accounting for the anisotropic nature of the pixel filter footprint into texture space. This
		extension provides a general mechanism for supporting anisotropic texturing filtering schemes without specifying a particular formulation of anisotropic
		filtering.

		The extension permits the OpenGL application to specify on a per-texture object basis the maximum degree of anisotropy to account for in texture
		filtering.

		Increasing a texture object's maximum degree of anisotropy may improve texture filtering but may also significantly reduce the implementation's texture
		filtering rate. Implementations are free to clamp the specified degree of anisotropy to the implementation's maximum supported degree of anisotropy.

		A texture's maximum degree of anisotropy is specified independent from the texture's minification and magnification filter (as opposed to being
		supported as an entirely new filtering mode). Implementations are free to use the specified minification and magnification filter to select a particular
		anisotropic texture filtering scheme. For example, a NEAREST filter with a maximum degree of anisotropy of two could be treated as a 2-tap filter that
		accounts for the direction of anisotropy. Implementations are also permitted to ignore the minification or magnification filter and implement the
		highest quality of anisotropic filtering possible.

		Applications seeking the highest quality anisotropic filtering available are advised to request a GL11#LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR minification filter, a
